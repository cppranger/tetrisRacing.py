# tetrisRacing.py
Old-fashioned racing game from old russian tetris now on Python! 
I thought it would be RC, but let it be 1.0 LTS, heh

- new graphics and non-licenced music
- new gameplay elements
- menu
- some music effects

this code is begging for refactoring, but i think, i leave it as it is (or not)
